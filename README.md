# Overview

Learning a new language is always going to be hard. There are always going to be obstacles to overcome, whether they are introduced by the language or self-generated. As a software engineer, I need to overcome these obstacles and create something useful. I feel as though I have done just that with this project!

Task Manager was written in Kotlin. It demonstrates a few strengths the language possesses: the "when" statement, its ties with Java, and intuitive class declaration. It combines these in an application that allows different people to create their own list of tasks. All you do is log in or register (using a username of your choice), add a few tasks, and quit. When you want to check back in or remove tasks, just log in and do so.

This piece of software was meant to challenge my ability to adapt to new languages. Kotlin is based on Java and shares almost all of its functionality and packages. It is extremely different in syntax, however. I wanted to test how well I could pick it up and write exactly what I was thinking into existence.

# Development Environment

Since Kotlin is developed by JetBrains, I opted to use their Java-ready IDE, IntelliJ Idea. This made it relatively easy to set up all the files and any tools needed for my project.

Kotlin is like a marriage of Java and Python. Where Java is a language that can be minimized (i.e. all the formatting whitespace removed), Kotlin is not. Where Python allows the user to completely omit data types, Kotlin is not. In my opinion, Kotlin is good mix of both. It's easy to

# Future Work

- Add better registration
- Fix "\n" character at the end of files
- Create a User class

## NOTE
The actual program is stored in TaskManager -> src -> main -> kotlin -> Main.kt. The program will create all the files it needs, so don't worry about initializing any .txt files.
